\section{Possible Quality Issues in SKOS Vocabularies}\label{sec:criteria}

% Briefly describe methodology

We identified an initial set of possible quality issues in SKOS vocabularies by reviewing existing literature and manually examining existing vocabularies. We published our findings online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cmader/qSKOS/wiki/Quality-Criteria-for-SKOS-Vocabularies}} and requested feedback from experts via public mailing list and informal face to face discussions. Based on the received responses, we then selected a subset of these issues and formalized them into computable \textbf{quality checking functions}. Each function operates on a SKOS vocabulary, which we define, for the purpose of this work, as follows:

\begin{definition}[SKOS Vocabulary] Let a SKOS vocabulary be a tuple of the form $V = \langle IR, C, SR, ULV \rangle$, with \(IR = I_{CEXT}(\texttt{rdfs:Resource}^\mathcal{I})\) being the set of \textbf{resources}, \(C = I_{CEXT}(\texttt{skos:Concept}^\mathcal{I})\) being the set of \textbf{concepts}, \(SR = I_{EXT}(\texttt{skos:semanticRelation}^\mathcal{I})\) being the set of \textbf{semantic relations} associating conceptual resources with one another, and $LV \subseteq I_{CEXT}(\texttt{rdfs:Literal}^\mathcal{I})$ being the set of untyped \textbf{plain literals}. Further, we let $V$ be the fully entailed RDFS interpretation~\cite{RDFSEM2012} of the underlying RDF graph, enriched by entailment of \texttt{owl:inverseOf} properties. 

\end{definition}

A quality checking function is applied on a given SKOS vocabulary and finds all vocabulary resources that match a certain issue and might degrade the overall quality of a vocabulary. Therefore, we can formalize a quality issue in terms of an abstract function $f:V \rightarrow \mathcal{P}(IR)$ that maps a given vocabulary $v \in V$ to the powerset of its resources. Each quality issue we found can be implemented as a realization of that abstract function and possibly take additional parameters. Statistical analysis can be computed on top of the result set.

In the following, we explain the origins and design rationale for each quality issue (QI) and define the corresponding quality checking function. For better readability and due to lack of space we provide only semi-formal definitions and refer to the online documentation and the implementation source code for further details. We also categorized the identified quality issues into \emph{Labeling and Documentation Issues}, \emph{Structural Issues}, \emph{Linked Data Specific Issues}, and \emph{Other Issues}. 


% LABELING AND DOCUMENTATION ISSUES

\subsection{Labeling and Documentation Issues}

The following issues primarily focus on possible problems that might arise when human users work with a SKOS vocabulary or interact with a system that uses the vocabulary for, e.g., search and retrieval purposes.

\paragraph{QI 1: Omitted or Invalid Language Tags}

% Origin and rationale
SKOS defines a set of properties that link resources with RDF Literals, which are plain text natural language strings with an optional language tag. This includes the labeling properties \texttt{skos:prefLabel}, \texttt{skos:altLabel}, \texttt{skos:hiddenLabel} and also SKOS documentation properties, such as \texttt{skos:note} and subproperties thereof. Omitting language tags or using non-standardized, private language tags in a SKOS vocabulary could unintentionally limit the result set of language-dependent structural queries.
% Function defintion
We can check a SKOS vocabulary for omitted and invalid language tags by defining a quality checking function $oilt$ that iterates over all resources in $IR$ and finds those that have relations to plain literals with missing or invalid language tags, hence tags that are not defined in RFC3066\footnote{RFC 3066: Tags for the Identification of Languages \url{http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3066.txt}}.

\paragraph{QI 2: Incomplete Language Coverage}

% Origin and rationale
Soergel et al.~\cite{Soergel1997} point out that ``the problem that has bedeviled many developers of multilingual thesauri is that a concept lexicalized in one language may not be lexicalized in another...''. In the context of SKOS, this means that the set of language tags used by the literal values linked with a concept should be the same for all concepts. This is particularly important for applications that rely on internationalization and translation use cases.
% Function defintion
We identify affected the concepts by a function $ilc$ that first extracts the global set of language tags used in a vocabulary from all literal values attached to all concepts in $C$. In a second iteration over all concepts it identifies all concepts having a set of language tags that is not equal to the global language set.

\paragraph{QI 3: Undocumented Concepts}

% Origin and rationale
Svenonius~\cite{Svenonius1997} advocates the ``inclusion of as much definition material as possible'' and the SKOS language specification~\cite{SkosReference2008} defines a set of properties, denoted as ``documentation properties'', that are intended to hold this kind of information.
% Function defintion
To identify all undocumented concepts, we define a function $uc$ we iterate over all concepts in $C$ and by default collect those that do not use any of these documentation properties.

\paragraph{QI 4: Label Conflicts}

% Origin and rationale
This issue is an extension of a statement from the SKOS Primer~\cite{Isaac2009} that recommends that ``no two concepts have the same preferred lexical label in a given language when they belong to the same concept scheme''. We reviewed existing vocabularies and applications and found that (i) many vocabularies don't use concept schemes and (ii) identical \texttt{skos:altLabels} or \texttt{skos:hiddenLabels} can also negatively affect use cases such as auto-completion, which proposes labels based on the user input.
% Function defintion
Thus, we generalize this statement and define a function $lc$ that finds all concept pairs with their respective \texttt{skos:prefLabel}, \texttt{skos:altLabel} or \texttt{skos:hiddenLabel} property values meeting a certain similarity threshold defined by a function $sim:ULV \times ULV \rightarrow [0,1]$. The default, built-in similarity function checks for case-insensitive string equality with a threshold equal to 1. The function iterates over all concept pairs $C \times C$, applies $sim$ to every possible label combination, and collects those pairs with at least one label combination that meet or exceed a specified similarity threshold.

% STRUCTURAL METRICS

\subsection{Structural Criteria}

The commonality of the following criteria is that they identify possible weaknesses when $V$ is used in scenarios exploiting the structure of its RDF graph. 

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 5: Loose Concepts}} \todo{BH}{rename this to Orphan Concepts?}

This quality function is motivated by the notion of ``orphan terms'' in the literature~\cite{Hedden2010}, which are are terms without any associative or hierarchical relationships. Checking for them is common in existing thesaurus development applications and also suggested by \cite{Z39.19:2005}. All vocabularies expressed in SKOS are concept-centric, thus we understand a loose concept is a concept that has no semantic relations with other conceptual resources i.e. it does not occur in any of the pairs yielded by $SR$. Although they might have attached lexical labels, they lack valuable context information that is considered essential for, e.g., search query expansion. Calculation can be done by iterating over all elements in $C$, filtering those not having a semantic relation to any other conceptual resource. 

% \begin{definition}
% Let \(G_{lc} = (C, SR)\) and \(deg(c)\) be the degree, hence the number of in- and outgoing edges, of a node $c \in C$ in the graph $G_{lc}$. We can then define loose concepts as a function \(lc : G \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{0}\), with \[lc(g) = \left|\left\{c \in C : deg(c) = 0\right\}\right|\]
% \end{definition}

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 6: Weakly Connected Components}} indicate that the vocabulary is split into separate ``clusters''. Presence of several WCC might be caused by incomplete data acquisition, ``forgotten'' test data, outdated terms, accidental deletion of relations and the like. In a practical setting, existence of weakly connected components could render the vocabulary less suitable for operations that rely on navigating a connected vocabulary structure, such as query expansion or suggestion of related terms. To calculate WCC, we create an undirected graph whose set of nodes constitutes all non-loose concepts and whose edges are defined by $SR$. We then utilize ``Tarjan’s algorithm''\cite{Hopcroft1973} that finds all connected components of the graph, i.e. all sets of conceptual resources that can reach each other by a path of semantic relations.

% \begin{definition}
% To evaluate this criterion we consider a graph \(G_{wcc} = (C - lc(G_{lc}), SR)\). The function \(components(g) : G \rightarrow  \mathfrak{P}(G)\) calculates all weakly connected components of a graph by replacing all directed edges by undirected edges and utilizing “Tarjan’s algorithm” \cite{Hopcroft1973}. Based on that function, we can express this criterion as a function \(wcc : G \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{0}\), with \[wcc(g) = \left|components(g)\right|\]
% \end{definition}
 

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 7: Cyclic Hierarchical Relations}} have been mentioned numerous times in thesaurus development literature. \cite{Soergel2002} suggests a ``check for hierarchy cycles" since they ``throw the program for a loop in the generation of a complete hierarchical structure''. However, SKOS does not define a formal constraint regarding hierarchy cycles but \cite{SkosReference2008} mentions them as potential problems. The SKOS documentation also does not state, how exactly hierarchical relationships are to be interpreted. There exist common forms like, e.g., ``generic-specific'', ``instance-of'' or ``whole-part'' \cite{Hedden2010,Harpring2010,Aitchison2000} where cycles would be considered a logical contradiction. To calculate this criterion, we construct two graphs, with the set of nodes being $C$. The edges in one graph only point towards the broader concepts, the edges of the other graph point towards the narrower concepts. For each graph we now identify those nodes that are part of a cycle and return the set of strongly connected components they are contained in.

%Erkärung: ein knoten (konzept) liegt oft in vielen überlappenden kreisen und es würde keinen sinn machen, diese alle auszugeben. deshalb berechne ich mir von jedem knoten der in einem kreis liegt, in welcher starken zusammenhangskomponente er liegt. das sind dann per definition alle knoten, die mit irgendeinem kreis in dem das konzept liegt was zu tun haben, weil eine starke zusammenhangskomponente ja eigentlich nur aus kreisen besteht (von jedem knoten gibt es einen gerichteten weg zu jedem anderen knoten)
 
% \begin{definition}
% Let \(H_{br} \subseteq SR\) be the set of pairs of hierarchically broader related resources, i.e. \(I_{EXT}(\texttt{skos:broader}^\mathcal{I}) \cup I_{EXT}(\texttt{skos:broaderTransitive}^\mathcal{I}) \cup I_{EXT}(\texttt{skos:broadMatch}^\mathcal{I})\). \(H_{br}\) also includes the extensions of the respecitive inverse properties with each pair in reverse order. Likewise, \(H_{nar} \subseteq SR\) can be defined as the set of hierarchically narrower related resources. We consider two graphs \(G_{br} = (C,H_{br})\) and \(G_{nar}=(C,H_{nar})\) and a function \(cycleNodes:G \rightarrow \mathfrak{P}(C)\) identifying all nodes in a graph, that are part of a cycle. Furthermore we consider a function \(stronglyConnectedSets: G \rightarrow \mathfrak{P}(C)\) that calculates all sets of nodes contained in a strongly connected subgraph of $G$. This criterion can be defined as a function \(chr:G \rightarrow \mathbb{N}_{0}\) with \[chr(g)=\left|\left\{s \in stronglyConnectedSets(g) : cn \in cycleNodes(g), cn \in s\right\}\right|\]
% \end{definition}


\paragraph{\textbf{QF 8: Valueless Associative Relations}}
The ISO/DIS 25964-1 standard suggests that terms that share a common broader term but do not have an overlapping meaning, should not be related associatively. This is also advocated by \cite{Hedden2010} and \cite{Aitchison2000} who also mentions ``the risk that thesaurus compilers may overload the thesaurus with valueless relationships'', having a negative effect on precision. This function identifies a set of pairs of conceptual resources that share the same broader or narrower concept while also being associatively related by the property \texttt{skos:related}.

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 9: Solely Transitively Related Concepts}}
Two concepts are related using only transitive hierarchical relations which are, according to \cite{SkosReference2008}, ``not used to make assertions''. Transitive hierarchical relations in SKOS are meant to be infered by the vocabulary user, which is reflected in the SKOS schema by, e.g., \texttt{skos:broader} being a subproperty of \texttt{skos:broaderTransitive}. This fuction iterates over all pairs of concepts $C \times C$ that are \textbf{explicitly} related by \texttt{skos:broaderTransitive} and/or \texttt{skos:narrowerTransitive}, i.e. \textbf{without} RDFS subproperty entailment.

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 10: Omitted Top Concepts}}
The SKOS language provides concept schemes, which are a facility for grouping related concepts. In order to provide entry points to such a group of concepts, one or more concepts can be marked as top concepts. This helps to provide ``efficient access''~\cite{Isaac2009} and simplifies orientation in the vocabulary. To calculate this function, we iterate over all \texttt{skos:ConceptScheme}s in $V$ and collect those that occur in relations established by the properties \texttt{skos:hasTopConcept} or \texttt{skos:topConceptOf}.

\paragraph{\textbf{QF 11: Top Concept Having Broader Concepts}}
\cite{Allemang2011} proposes to ``not indicate any concepts internal to the tree as top concepts'', i. e. top concepts should not have broader concepts. This criteria iterates over all \texttt{skos:TopConcept}s defined in $V$ and collects those that are related to a resource by the \texttt{skos:broader} property.

% LINKED-DATA SPECIFIC CRITERIA

\subsection{Linked Data Specific Criteria}

This section identifies criteria related to a vocabulary's interaction with other datasets in the LOD cloud.

\subsubsection{Missing In-Links}
A periodically updated version of a diagram visualizing ``the data sets in the LOD cloud as well as their interlinkage relationships'' is publised online\footnote{\url{http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/lodcloud/state/}}. In these diagrams, DBpedia is shown as the most intensely linked resource, i.e. a large number of vocabularies link to resources in that dataset. This indicates that a dataset with a large number of other datasets referencing it, can be assumed to be of great value for the community, adding cohesion to the LOD cloud. Accordingly, estimating the number of In-Links of SKOS concepts defined in a vocabulary (henceforth called the in-degree of a concept) gives some hint about how established or accepted a controlled vocabulary is. A method to carry out these estimations would be utilizing existing Linked Data indices like, e.g., Sindice\footnote{\url{http://sindice.com/}} that provide a SPARQL endpoint. In order to estimate the number of In-Links for a conceptual resource, we iterate over all elements in $C$ and query the Sindice SPARQL endpoint for triples containing the concept's URI in the object part. Those concepts having an empty query result, are missing any In-Links and are thus included in the result set of this criterion.

\subsubsection{Missing Out-Links}
The Web of Data consists of globally interconnected datasets, ``enabling seamless connections between data sets''\cite{Heath2011}. These links can be established between various SKOS vocabularies by Out-Links, i.e., references from conceptual resources in the ``source vocabulary'' $V$ to resources identified by an HTTP URI and available at a different host. Similar to the criterion above, this criterion identifies the set of all conceptual resources that lack such Out-Links. Calculation of the result set is done by iterating over all elements $c \in C$ and investigating the host part of all related resources. If none of these host names differ from the host part of $c$, it has no Out-Links and is thus included into the resources identified by this criterion.

%\subsubsection{HTTP URI Schema Violation}\todo{All}{We don't have any evidence this really happens in existing vocabularies, although it is very likely. Maybe we should skip this.}

\subsubsection{Link Target Unavailability} \todo{BH}{should we just call this "Broken Links" because that's essentially what it's all about}
This criterion identifies a set of all resources that have been identified as unavailable, i.e. resolving their URI leads to an erroneous HTTP response or no response at all. An erroneous HTTP response in that case can be defined as a response code (after a possible redirection) other than 200. Just as in the ``traditional'' Web, these ``broken links'' hinder information gathering and should be avoided. Calculation of this criterion is performed by iterating over all resources in $IR$, performing an HTTP request and include those resources in the result set that are unavailable.

% OTHER CRITERIA

\subsection{Other Criteria}

\subsubsection{Undefined SKOS Resource Usage}
Some vocabularies reference resources in the SKOS namespace that cannot be resolved. A common reason for this is, that there seems to exist a misunderstanding about the correct way of introducing new classes or properties in an OWL document. In some cases, vocabularies ``invent'' new terms in the SKOS namespace in order to meet certain requirements of the publishing organizations that cannot (yet) be expressed within the SKOS schema. Another reason for the presence of unresolvable resource references in the SKOS namespace is that the vocabulary might be outdated. With the SKOS W3C recommendation maturing, some properties have been removed from the current version of the schema. Vocabularies using these ``deprecated'' properties hence contain parts of their information in a non ``standard"-compliant way, having negative effects when, e.g., crawling vocabularies to gather specific information. A method to identify these undefined SKOS resources is to iterate over all resources in $IR$, including (i) those resources in the resulting set that are contained in the list of deprecated resources or (ii) have an URI in the SKOS namespace but are not defined in the SKOS ontology.
