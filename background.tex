% About Quality in SKOS vocabularies

SKOS is a language for defining vocabularies in the Web of Data and therefore based on the Open World Assumption. Established quality notions from closed-world systems, such as referential integrity or schema validation, don't hold anymore, because the available information may be incomplete and facts that are not explicitly stated cannot be determined as true or false. While trust and provenance models for Web data are being developed~\cite{Omitola2011,Hartig2009}, content-based and hand-crafted heuristics are currently used to evaluate quality in Linked Data sets~\cite{Heath2011}. In the course of the LATC project, Gueret et al. propose an infrastructure that utilizes crowd-sourcing technology to semi-automatically create links between datasets of the LOD cloud. To ensure the quality of the resulting network, human judgement is supported by calculating a report of locally approximated network measures. \todo{BH}{ich denke antoine hat das paper gemeint: http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/18928/4084690763/56bdde328dfbba2cb8594b57152c0e132ef00a40/dl.pdf .

% SKOS Integrity Conditions (http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/):
% S9    skos:ConceptScheme is disjoint with skos:Concept.
% S13   skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel are pairwise disjoint properties. (* NOT expressed formally *)
% S14   A resource has no more than one value of skos:prefLabel per language tag. (* NOT expressed formally *)
% S27   skos:related is disjoint with the property skos:broaderTransitive. (* NOT expressed formally *)
% S37   skos:Collection is disjoint with each of skos:Concept and skos:ConceptScheme.
% S46   skos:exactMatch is disjoint with each of the properties skos:broadMatch and skos:relatedMatch. (* NOT expressed formally *)
% -> 2 of 6 are expressed formally in OWL; the others cannot be expressed because OWL doesn't support disjoint properties

% Poolparty quality checker implementation:
% S13, S14, S27, S46 plus the formally defined S9, S37
% syntactic checks: URI, character encoding, whitespaces
% missing language tags: in SKOS labels and textual content)
% missing labels: prefLabels for skos:Concepts and rdfs:labels for skos:ConceptSchemes)
% loose concepts: concepts that are no top concepts and have no broaders

% SKOSify
% S13, S14, S27

% Mapping qSKOS Integrity Conditions <-> qSKOS quality criteria
% S13 + S14 combined in "Ambigious labels"
% S27 + S46 combined in "Associative vs. Hierarchical Relation Clashes" and "Exact vs. Associative and Hierarchical Mapping Clashes"

Interoperability between applications has been the major motivation for specifying in total six \textbf{SKOS integrity conditions}~\cite{Miles2005}. An integrity condition is a statement that defines under which circumstances data are consistent with the SKOS data model. An example condition is ``A resource has no more than one value of skos:prefLabel per language tag''. Tools can check whether these integrity conditions are met for given data. Two of the six integrity conditions are defined formally in the OWL representation of SKOS and can therefore be verified by any OWL reasoner. 

The PoolParty Thesaurus Consistency Checker implements all these conditions and introduces the following new checks: \textbf{URI validation} checks for invalid characters like, e.g. whitespaces in the URI string. \textbf{Definition of labels} is tested for conceptual resources and concept schemes. Furthermore, SKOS labels and textual content is checked for \textbf{missing language tags} and the notion of \textbf{loose concepts} is defined: it encompasses conceptual resources that are no top concepts and have no broader concept.

The SKOSify tool implements three of the above mentioned SKOS integrity conditions as well as the \textbf{missing language tags} and \textbf{loose concepts} measures introduced by the PoolParty checker. It introduces \textbf{hierarchy cycle detection} and detection of \textbf{extra whitespace} for SKOS label or documentation properties.

% Argue why we need higher-level criteria

\todo{CM}{argue why quality criteria beyond integrity conditions are needed; provide some good arguments and refer to the literature. The focus of this paragraph should be on quality in the controlled vocabulary domain...}

% Methodology

Our goal was to identify quality criteria that go beyond SKOS integrity conditions. These criteria do not primarily address interoperability on the data model level but usability and interoperability in the application areas mentioned before. We used the following sources for our investigation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing literature
    \item Mailing list discussions
    \item \ldots \todo{cm}{think about and finish this paragraph and lists.}
\end{itemize}

After we identified an initial set of criteria, we formalized them into computable metrics and applied them on existing SKOS vocabularies to learn about the real-world occurrences of these criteria. During that process we also learned about additional quality issues in real world SKOS data, refined already identified criteria and included additional ones in a SKOS quality criteria catalogue, which we published online\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cmader/qSKOS/wiki/Quality-Criteria-for-SKOS-Vocabularies}}.
