The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) has become the standard model for expressing and publishing controlled vocabularies on the Web. However, SKOS vocabularies are often heterogeneous in terms of quality, which reduces their applicability across system boundaries. Here we investigate how we can support domain experts with quantitative indicators to judge the quality of SKOS vocabularies. Based on existing guidelines and best practices for creating controlled vocabularies, we identified existing \textbf{quality criteria} and formalized them into computable \textbf{quality metrics}. We implemented them in the qSKOS quality assessment tool and used it to analyze the quality of existing vocabularies. The results from this analysis indicate that \todo{CM,BH}{summarize results in one sentence}.
